# Streamkit RPC

This is an even more experimental RPC layer on top of Streamkit. If nothing else it shows how you can layer on top of Streamkit. There is likely not much development in the future for Streamkit RPC since [Duplex](http://github.com/progrium/duplex) has finally shaken out. Streamkit was originally a proof of concept called Duplex until Duplex solidified as a simpler RPC protocol.
